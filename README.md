# Title: Snyk Vulnerability Report

**Description:** In this project, using a python script (report_parse_script), I extracted the *title*, *severity*, *cvss_score* fields from a synk vulnerability scan report (snyk-report.json).  These parameters were then parse into a csv file (report_parse_result).


**Implementation:** From your terminal, type `python report_parse_script snyk-report.json`
